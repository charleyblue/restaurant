          <p class="">Our mission is to help you focus on your customers and your kitchen or store front by performing professional bookkeeping services for your operations. We specialize in the retail food service industry with our complete cloud-based bookkeeping services. C&amp;M Bookkeeping manages your accounts payable and receivable, cash register and merchant account reports, P&amp;L Statement, Balance Sheet, and bank reconciliation. </p>
          <p>Every restaurant, bar, and grocery store owner must plan on the inventory purchases for the product to be sold. Restaurants must figure out how much raw food to purchase for each day of operation with the least amount of waste. Bars must keep an inventory of product on hand to meet your daily demand. And, grocery stores must keep their customers happy by having the popular items on the shelves. All this takes planning and research to create a system that keeps the dining room busy, the bar patrons drinking, and the shoppers coming back.</p>
          <p class="">We set up an encrypted internet service to securely share your company financial files between you and C&amp;M Bookkeeping. We then set up your company accounts according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or integrate your existing accounting records into QuickBooks Online or Xero.</p>
